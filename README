NAME
     xxdc - hexadecimal dump to C include file

SYNOPSIS
     xxdc [infile]

DESCRIPTION
     The xxdc utility reads infile and writes a hexadecimal static array
     definition and array length to the standard output in a form suitable for
     inclusion in a C program.  If infile is a single dash (`-') or absent,
     xxdc reads from the standard input and does not write out the array
     definition nor the array length.

     The array definition is named after infile as unsigned char infile[].
     The array length is named after infile as unsigned int infile_len.

EXIT STATUS
     The xxdc utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
